# AI Relocation App - Project Discontinued

## Project Status: DISCONTINUED (January 2026)
This project has been discontinued following the PMLC validation. While the technical foundation was sound, market validation revealed insufficient user need to justify continued development.
This repository serves as evidence of product thinking and technical execution capabilities:

## Product Strategy: Vision, mission, and customer persona development
- Technical Architecture: Serverless infrastructure using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Terraform
- Agile Practices: Sprint planning, backlog management, and user story development
- Strategic Decision-Making: Data-driven product kill decisions based on PMLC validation

## The Vision
Build a relocation app for cloud professionals to answer: "Can I afford to move from City A to City B on my current salary?"
The app would aggregate cost-of-living data across 214 US metro areas and calculate salary requirements for maintaining lifestyle or achieving goals like homeownership.

## Why It Was Discontinued
After earning my CSPO cert and going for the CAPM exam, I applied proper product validation techniques that should have been used before development began.

## Market Validation Results
###  Target Market Analysis:
- Oct 2025 tech layoffs primarily affected UI/UX, AI/ML Engineering, Software Development, Recruiting, and Marketing.
- Cloud professionals (target users) largely retained employment.
- Market indicators suggest AI/ML bubble contraction while quantum computing emergence will increase cloud demand

### Economic Context:
- Jobs are paying at or above market rates
- Cost of living decreasing in many metros nationwide
- LinkedIn data showed hiring announcements, not layoffs among cloud professionals

## Resource Reality:
- Single-person team serving as PM, PO, and engineer
- Time constraints from active job search and CAPM exam preparation
- AWS free tier approaching expiration requiring out-of-pocket costs for unfinished product

## Conclusion: User need wasn't urgent enough to justify continued investment.

# I built on assumptions, not validation:
## This is a textbook case of solution-first thinking instead of problem-first thinking.
### What I Learned
-Product Management Lessons
-Discovery Before Delivery: Validate assumptions before writing code. The most valuable outcome of discovery can be learning what NOT to build.
-Resource Constraints Are Real: The project management triangle (scope, time, cost) isn't theoretical. As a one-person team, I underestimated capacity requirements.
-Kill Decisions Are Product Decisions: Knowing when to stop is as important as knowing when to start. The PMLC validation stage exists to catch mistakes before they become expensive failures.
-User Needs ≠ Personal Needs: Just because I wanted a solution doesn't mean others needed it at scale.

## Documentation
### GitHub Wiki: Comprehensive product documentation including:
-Product Foundation (vision, mission, personas)
-Product Journey (development timeline and pivot decisions)
-Product Management Artifacts (backlog philosophy, sprint documentation)
-Sprints (Sprint 1 & 2 planning and execution)

The decision to discontinue this project is itself evidence of product management maturity. I'm grateful I learned this lesson on a side project rather than at a company with real budget and stakeholder expectations.
